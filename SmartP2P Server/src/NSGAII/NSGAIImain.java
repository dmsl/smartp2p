/*
 * This is framework for searching objects (e.g. images, etc.) captured 
 * by the users in a mobile social community. Our framework is founded on an 
 * in-situ data storage model, where captured objects remain local on their owner’s 
 * smartphones and searches take place over a lookup structure we compute dynamically. 
 * Initially, a query user invokes a search to find an object of interest. 
 * Our structure concurrently optimizes several conflicting objectives using a 
 * MultiObjective Optimization approach and calculates a set of high quality nondominated 
 * Query Routing Trees (QRTs) in a single run. The optimal set is then forwarded to the query 
 * user to select a QRT to be searched based on instant requirements and preferences. 
 * To demonstrate the SmartP2P we utilize our cloud of smartphones (SmartLab) composed 
 * of 40 Android devices. The conference attendees will be able to appreciate how social 
 * content can be efficiently shared without revealing their personal content to a centralized 
 * authority.
